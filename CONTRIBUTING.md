## Contributing to YB

The goal of YB is to be a tool that local development more productive while
keeping the CI / release build process in-sync. As developers we know how
important tooling is and encourage contributions from the community to make the
experience even better. 

Currently we do not have a formally-defined process for accepting contributions
(we are working on that) but we do have a few things we ask of those who want to 
participate in the process:

1. Be polite - provide constructive criticism in a way that is
   encouraging and helpful!

2. Ask questions - if you are unsure of something (process, value, design) feel
   free to ask in an issue or open a pull request with some changes. 

3. Have fun! One of the primary goals of the YB tooling is to make development
   easier and less painful; contributing to it should be the same way.
